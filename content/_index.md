Hello there! The name is Tyler, I'm a **sysadmin** and **web developer** with a passion for solving problems and serving others by utilizing technology. I thrive by helping others achieve their goals, and by making their job more streamlined and efficient.

I am a well-rounded and versatile **technology expert**, that has had the privilege of working and gaining valuable real world experience in the IT field. From server administration, managing data centers, leading team members, writing software, developing websites, and everything in-between. 

I strongly believe that in life one should **always be learning** and this is something I have taken to heart and have made it my mission to always be on top of the latest technology trends. I have strong project management skills and I have **continually** delivered and completed projects on time, even when working with limited resources and strict timelines. 

You can [contact me](/contact) and view the projects I'm currently working on at [Github](https://github.com/jtgry).
