1. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
2. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hit me with a cricket bat. You hit me with a cricket bat.

You hit me with a cricket bat. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
