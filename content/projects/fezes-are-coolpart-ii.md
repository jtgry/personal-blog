You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You've swallowed a planet! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

1. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
2. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
3. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
