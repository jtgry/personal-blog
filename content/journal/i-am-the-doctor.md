I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
